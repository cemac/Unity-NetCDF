## Representing mesh vertices as a point cloud

1. Create a game object in the Unity hierarchy panel called 'point_mesh'
2. Assign a mesh filter and a mesh renderer to the object
3. Save 'pointCloud.shader' as a shader in Unity and create a new material based on this called 'point cloud'. Assign this material to the mesh renderer.
4. Assign the script 'pointCloud.cs' to the object
5. Run the scene. You should be able to change the aesthetics of the point cloud using the slides in the Inspector panel:
